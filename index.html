          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational
          methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
          directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
          of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education
          can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that
          has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
          pedagogy.

          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
          knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
          pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
          imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
          generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge
          beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal
          education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the
          Middle Kingdom.[2] Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the
          Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607.[

          Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
          purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in
          a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning
          together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school
          systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all
          educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum,
          organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g.
          classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment,
          class size, educational activities, and more.
